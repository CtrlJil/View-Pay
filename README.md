## The Need for a Seamless Viewing Experience
Imagine.

It is the Uefa Champions League final, your favorite team has overcome all odds defeating giants, and slaying the galacticos on their way to this ultimate fixture. And now to crown an epic run and make history for the club and fans they must now face one last hurdle. 
Your nerves are on edge. This is the most important match of the club's history.

The stadium is packed full.

You can feel the energy radiating through the tv as the champions league anthem starts off.

The shrill of the whistle signals kick-off.
The first few minutes features end-to-end action. Both teams trying to get that first goal.
Your team wins possession deep inside their own half and begin to build.
A pass here, a dribble there. Quick touches. Exciting play. Something might be cooking here.
And just at that moment. 

"Oga, your money for ball"

GOAAALLLLLLL!!!!

Your team has scored the opening goal of the final.
Who scored? How did they score?

They eventually go on to win the trophy, cementing their name in the hall of legends.

The most epic moment in your club's history and you spent it dueling with Mr Onile.
